README FILE WITH LATEX TEMPLATE utitcphd_overleaf.cls

This template as hosted at overleaf.com is a PhD thesis template in use at the University of Twente, Department of Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (better known as ITC), The Netherlands.

Otherwise, this template has a long history, is based on memoir.cls, and has a lineage of a very fine array of previous PhD candidates who have graciously contributed to its fine-tuning.  Template maintenance is never finished and I continue being happy to receive comments to its further improvement.

There exists an offline version of this template for use on local machines, away from overleaf.  It is subtly different.

The template itself also has a small manual, which gets installed with the template.
